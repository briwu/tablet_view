        <p>
          Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days
          lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has
          gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long
          as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to
          avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like
          skills in chasing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon
          suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on
          a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
          ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.
        </p>

        <p>
          Biscuit is a 2 year old shiba inu dog. Shiba inus are energetic and
          playful dogs. Biscuit enjoys running outside in circles and then
          laying down in the grass in the sun for hours. He also likes going for
          occasional swims.
        </p>
        <p>
          As energetic as Biscuit is, he also likes to relax. He loves to sleep
          in his dog bed and watch Netflix with his owners. His favorite treat
          is apples.

        <p>
          Carter was born in Seattle. However, my brother bought him and brought
          him to Boston. Whenever my brother did not have time to walk Carter,
          he would put him on the treadmill. When Carter became too much of a
          responsibility for my brother as a college student, he took Carter to
          Vancouver to live with my mom, sister, and me. Because we lived in the
          mountains, he would sometimes howl in the middle of the night whenever
          he saw a wild animal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever I threw him a ball, he ran to the ball but never brought it
          back to me. He would sometimes escape the backyard of our house if we
          forgot to close the gates by accident. Even if we looked for him
          everywhere and did not find him, he knew the way home and always came
          back in the end. He loved going to the forest and the beach. He had
          his own spot on the living room couch and would television with us if
          he was bored or tired.

        <p>
          Bo is a Portuguese Water Dog with black and white fur. His paws are
          white too, so they always get dirty when outside. He is 12 years old,
          but he still likes to run around outside a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          He has an abundance of toys but only likes to play with a couple. He
          enjoys going on walks and especially on trails in the woods. He has a
          few dog friends that he likes to go on playdates with as well.

        <p>
          Chief is a 9 year old pomeranian who loves to sleep as much as he can.
          He naps anywhere, ranging from someone's bed to the grass outside. He
          enjoys walking outside, but keep watch of him, otherwise he will try
          to consume geese poop.
        </p>
        <p>
          He does not like any toys anymore as when he was younger, he watched a
          bigger toy shred his favorite one to pieces. He used to know how to
          roll over, but now replaced that memory with a spin as it is much
          easier.

        >

        <p>
          Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go
          on walks, eat snacks and treats (not his own dog food), get pets and
          belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him playing with his toys
          in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or
          cooling off in the garage.
        </p>
        <p>
          He's still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings
          the doorbell, Cooky gets really excited, barking and dashing towards
          the front door. He also jumps really high when he's hyper and wags his
          tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as
          much as he likes to play.

        <p>
          Cooper is an 8yr old border collie and lab mix. We rescued him from
          the Humane Society as a puppy! He loves going on long walks/runs, but
          he stops to sniff something every few steps. He's pretty friendly, but
          he loves to loudly bark at delivery people who ring the doorbell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever it's movie night, Cooper has to join on the couch/bed or he
          feels left out. He loves to cuddle and pats on his tummy. Cooper will
          play fetch for about 2 or 3 rounds, but he quickly gets bored. He
          leaves his toys all around the house for the rest of the family to
          find.
