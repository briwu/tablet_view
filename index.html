          <p>
            Sequoia National Park is a large forest located in the Sierra Nevada
            mountain range in California. It is famous for its gigantic sequoia
            and redwood trees, as well as its underground Crystal Cave. The park
            is a well-known attraction to many tourists, receiving more than a
            million visitors annually. In addition to its collection of giant
            trees, Sequoia National Park is also home to thousands of prevalent
            flora and fauna.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps the most famous feature of Sequoia National Park is the
            General Sherman tree – the largest tree in the world. Measuring in at
            275 feet tall, the tree towers over the surrounding landscape and the
            people who come to view it. As of today, the General Sherman tree is
            estimated to be around 2200 years old.
